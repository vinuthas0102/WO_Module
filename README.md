## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Lucide React Icons
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom user management
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Build Tool**: Vite with TypeScript support

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Supabase account and project

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ticket-tracker
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Run all migration files in the `supabase/migrations/` directory in chronological order (they are numbered sequentially)
4. The migrations will create all necessary tables, policies, and seed data automatically

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Copy the `.env` file and update with your Supabase credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase project details:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

   You can find these values in your Supabase project settings under "API".

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Sample User Accounts

The application comes with pre-configured sample users for testing:

| Role | Username | Password | Department |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| Executive Officer | admin | admin | ADMINISTRATION |
| Department Officer | manager | manager | IT |
| Employee | user | user | IT |
| Employee | jane.doe | password | HR |
| Department Officer | hr.manager | hrpass | HR |
| Employee | finance.user | finance | FINANCE |
| Department Officer | finance.manager | financepass | FINANCE |

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

- **users**: User accounts with roles and departments
- **tickets**: Main ticket information with status and metadata
- **ticket_steps**: Individual steps within tickets
- **step_comments**: Comments on ticket steps
- **file_attachments**: File uploads for tickets and steps
- **audit_entries**: Complete audit trail of all changes

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all tables
- **Role-based Policies**: Users can only access data based on their role
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation rules
- **Audit Logging**: Automatic tracking of all data changes

## Key Features Explained

### Ticket Status Transitions

The application enforces proper ticket lifecycle management:

- **DRAFT**: Initial state, can move to CREATED
- **CREATED**: Submitted for review, can move to ACTIVE or CANCELLED
- **ACTIVE**: Work in progress, can move to COMPLETED or CANCELLED
- **COMPLETED**: Finished work, can be reopened to ACTIVE
- **CANCELLED**: Cancelled tickets, can be reinstated to CREATED

### Role-Based Access Control

Access is controlled at the database level using Supabase RLS policies:

- **Employees**: Can only see and modify their own tickets
- **Department Officers**: Can manage all tickets in their department
- **Executive Officers**: Have full access to all tickets

### Step Management

Each ticket can have multiple steps with:
- Sequential numbering
- Individual status tracking
- File attachments
- Comments and notes
- Assignment to specific users

### Audit Trail

Every action is logged including:
- Ticket creation and updates
- Status changes with remarks
- User information and timestamps
- Old and new values for changes

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables for Production

Ensure your production environment has the correct Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_supabase_anon_key
```

### Deployment Platforms

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- GitHub Pages

## Security Considerations

- All database queries use parameterized statements
- Row Level Security prevents unauthorized data access
- Input validation on both client and server side
- File upload restrictions and validation
- Session-based authentication with proper timeout

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify Supabase URL and API key
   - Check if RLS policies are properly configured
   - Ensure database schema is created correctly

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify user credentials match the sample data
   - Check browser console for authentication errors
   - Ensure Supabase project is active

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify RLS policies are enabled
   - Check user roles in the database
   - Ensure proper department assignments

### Development Tips

- Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
- Enable verbose logging in development mode
- Test with different user roles to verify access control
